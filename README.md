 Application Architecture
The project follows a component-based architecture:

App.js → Root component, wraps everything with Context Provider.

components/

TaskForm.js → Handles adding new tasks.

TaskList.js → Displays all tasks.

TaskItem.js → Represents individual tasks with remove/complete options.

context/

TaskContext.js → Defines state and actions for managing tasks using Context API.

styles/ → Contains CSS styling.

This separation ensures scalability, readability, and maintainability.

React Hooks and Context API Implementation
React Hooks Used

useState → To manage local state like input values and task completion.

useContext → To consume task state and actions provided by Context API.

useReducer (if used in your repo) → To manage complex state transitions (e.g., adding/removing tasks).

Context API

A TaskContext is created to provide global state.

The TaskProvider wraps the root component and exposes:

tasks → List of tasks.

addTask, removeTask, toggleTask → Functions to manipulate tasks.

This avoids prop drilling and ensures that all components can easily access task data and actions.
